SYNOPSIS
        get '/product/:sku/:name' => sub {
            add_to_history(
                type       => 'product',
                title      => param('name'),
                attributes => { sku => param('sku') }
            );
        };

        hook 'before_template_render' => sub {
            my $tokens = shift;
            $tokens->{previous_page} = history->previous_page->uri;
        };

DESCRIPTION
    The "add_to_history" keyword which is exported by this plugin allows you
    to add interesting items to the history lists which are returned using
    the "history" keyword.

KEYWORDS
  add_to_history
    Adds a page via "add" in Dancer2::Plugin::PageHistory::PageSet. Both of
    path and query_string are optional arguments which will be set
    automatically from the current request if they are not supplied.

  history
    Returns the current Dancer2::Plugin::PageHistory::PageSet object from
    the user's session.

SUPPORTED SESSION ENGINES
    CGISession, Cookie, DBIC, JSON, Memcached, MongoDB, PSGI, Redis, Sereal,
    Simple, YAML

CONFIGURATION
    No configuration is necessarily required.

    If you wish to have arguments passed to "new" in
    Dancer2::Plugin::PageHistory::PageSet these can be added to your
    configuration along with configuration for the plugin itself, e.g.:

        plugins:
          PageHistory:
            add_all_pages: 1
            ingore_ajax: 1 
            history_name: someothername
            PageSet:
              default_type: all
              fallback_page:
                path: "/"
              max_items: 20
              methods:
                - default
                - product
                - navigation

    Configuration options for the plugin itself:

    *   add_all_pages

        Defaults to 0. Set to 1 to have all pages added to the list
        "default_type" in Dancer2::Plugin::PageHistory::PageSet in the
        "before" hook.

    *   ignore_ajax

        If "add_all_pages" is true this controls whether ajax requests are
        added to the list "default_type" in
        Dancer2::Plugin::PageHistory::PageSet in the "before" hook.

        Defaults to 0. Set to 1 to have ajax requests ignored.

    *   history_name

        This setting can be used to change the name of the key used to store
        the history object in the session from the default "page_history" to
        something else. This is also the key used for name of the token
        containing the history object that is passed to templates.

HOOKS
    This plugin makes use of the following hooks:

  before
    Add current page to history. See "add_all_pages" and "ignore_ajax".

  before_template_render
    Puts history into the token "page_history".

TODO
    *   Add more tests
